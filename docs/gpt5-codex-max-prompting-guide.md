# The definitive prompting guide for GPT-5.1-Codex-Max

GPT-5.1-Codex-Max is OpenAI's frontier agentic coding model, purpose-built for long-running autonomous software engineering tasks—and it demands a fundamentally different prompting approach than previous models. Released November 19, 2025, this model introduces **native compaction** (coherent work across millions of tokens), achieves **77.9% on SWE-bench Verified** with 30% fewer thinking tokens, and can work independently for **24+ hours**.
