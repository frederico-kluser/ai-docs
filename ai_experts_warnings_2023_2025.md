# AI experts sounding the alarm: 2023-2025

The past two years have witnessed an unprecedented surge in public warnings about AI risks from the field's most respected figures. Since early 2023, prominent AI researchers and ethicists have delivered increasingly urgent messages about both immediate and existential dangers posed by rapidly advancing AI systems. Their warnings range from bias and misinformation concerns to potential civilization-ending scenarios, with many experts escalating their rhetoric as AI capabilities accelerate beyond earlier predictions. These public statements represent a dramatic shift from the previously optimistic tone that dominated AI discourse, indicating genuine alarm within the research community about our ability to control advanced AI systems.

## Geoffrey Hinton: From Google defector to Nobel laureate

### New York Times Interview - May 1-2, 2023
**Link:** New York Times article
**Key warnings:** In his headline-making resignation from Google, Hinton warned about AI creating a world where people "will not be able to know what is true anymore" and expressed surprise at the pace of advancement. He stated that AI could get smarter than humans much sooner than expected: "I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that."

### MIT EmTech Digital Interview - May 3, 2023

### International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI - January 2025
**Link:** Published by the UK Government with Bengio as chair
**Key warnings:** Bengio led 96 international experts documenting comprehensive AI risks in three categories: 1) Malicious use risks, including cyberattacks and potential biological weapons; 2) System malfunctions, including bias, reliability issues, and potential loss of control; 3) Broader societal risks, including economic disruption and power concentration.

### Senate Judiciary Subcommittee Testimony - July 25, 2023
**Key warnings:** Bengio testified about the need for international cooperation to control AI development, outlining a regime similar to international rules on nuclear technology. He explained that AI could concentrate economic, political, and military power in ways harmful for markets, democracy, and global stability.

## Eliezer Yudkowsky: The uncompromising alarmist

### TED2023 Talk: "Will Superintelligent AI End the World?" - April 18, 2023
**Link:** TED2023 Conference in Vancouver
**Key warnings:** Yudkowsky delivered perhaps the starkest warning that superintelligent AI would probably kill all humans. He stated: "I expect an actually smarter and uncaring entity will figure out strategies and technologies that can kill us quickly and reliably, and then kill us." He advocated for a complete halt to AI development rather than just a moratorium.

### TIME Magazine Op-Ed - March 29, 2023
**Link:** https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/

## Max Tegmark: Scientific perspective on control

### TED Talk: "How to Keep AI Under Control" - 2023
**Link:** TED's official channel
**Key warnings:** Tegmark warned that the current explosion of exciting commercial and open-source AI would likely be followed by "creepily superintelligent AI" which top researchers fear could disempower or wipe out humanity. He presented an optimistic vision for control but emphasized the urgent need for protective measures.

### Web Summit Talk - November 12, 2023
**Link:** Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal
**Key warnings:** Tegmark argued that AGI is advancing faster than anticipated and that optimistic claims about its controllability lack evidence. He advocated for focusing on "tool AI" rather than pursuing AGI, which he described as "unnecessary, undesirable, and preventable."

## Dario Amodei: Anthropic CEO on concrete timelines

### Senate Testimony - July 25, 2023
**Link:** U.S. Senate hearing on "Oversight of AI: Principles for Regulation"
**Key warnings:** Amodei warned that advanced AI could be used to create dangerous viruses and other bioweapons in **as little as two years**.

## Timnit Gebru: Focus on present harms

### Stanford Symbolic Systems Distinguished Speaker Lecture - February 15, 2023
**Link:** Stanford University event
**Key warnings:** Gebru warned about the dangers of pursuing Artificial General Intelligence, questioning why we would attempt to "build some undefined system that kind of sounds like a god." She argued that focusing on AGI is "inherently unsafe practice" and emphasized the risks of bias in AI systems, particularly for marginalized communities.

## Joy Buolamwini: Algorithmic justice advocate

### TED Talk: "Unmasking AI and Protecting What's Human" - 2023
**Link:** TED platform
**Key warnings:** Buolamwini explained how AI systems built on biased data can amplify inequalities, falsely accuse innocent people, and reverse progress. She called for protection of biometric rights and advocated for what she terms "algorithmic justice."

### Biden Administration AI Roundtable - April 2024
**Key warnings:** Buolamwini discussed with President Biden "the dangers of AI and what we can do to prevent harms already impacting everyday people" in areas including mortgages, housing, medical treatment, and workplace surveillance. She highlighted how facial recognition technology had led to wrongful arrests of people of color.

## Conclusion

These warnings represent an extraordinary consensus among AI's creators that the technology poses serious risks ranging from immediate social harms to potential extinction scenarios. While experts differ on timelines and specific dangers, almost all emphasize that existing governance frameworks are inadequate for the power and pace of AI development. What's particularly notable is how rapidly concerns have escalated - from primarily focusing on bias and misinformation in early 2023 to more existential warnings by 2025, indicating accelerating capabilities beyond even expert expectations.
